# Predicting-CO2-Emissions-Multiple-Linear-Regression
In this project i create a model using Multiple linear regression to determine the possible CO2 emission of a car given a numbers of parameters such as  the engine size, numbers of cylinders and fuel consumption. 
I used Python as the programming language and the libraries used are Pandas, Numpy,Seaborn, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn.

I have included a jupyter notebook file for those who want to use it directly.
